Hey there 👋

I'm a Software Engineer & Architect with a deep passion for AI/ML, scalable systems, and high-performance architectures. I specialize in designing databases, optimizing cloud solutions, and building AI-driven applications.

My tech stack includes Python 🐍, C, C++, TypeScript, and Golang, with expertise in FastAPI, Node.js, React, and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.

🚀 Currently leading an AI-powered research platform @ xaiQo, developing NLP models, automated research analysis, and blockchain-based AI licensing. I work on deep learning models for medical imaging, including MRI segmentation and spinal stenosis classification. Also, a competitive programmer preparing for contests like ACM ICPC.

🤖 Always exploring LLMs, reinforcement learning, and generative AI to push the limits of innovation.

If you'd like to collaborate on my AI/ML projects, feel free to reach out: igorjankowwski@gmail.com.

Happy coding! 😄🚀
